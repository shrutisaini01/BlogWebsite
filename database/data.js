    title: 'Two heads with brain looking opposite sides' ,
    content: "As most people know, it is the opposite side of the brain which is in control of the other side of your body. For example, the right hand is controlled by the left side of the brain and vice versa. Much like the author of this seminal book, I am a normal, everyday right-handed person who often gets confused over which direction is which (which may mean mixed dominance in the sides of the brain). However, the ‘dominant’ side is, in much of the population, the left side. Therefore, more people are right handed than left handed. Because of this, left-handedness has been given a bad rap throughout history (being referred to as ‘sinister’ and wrong — the hand of the devil in fact) and has led to many people actively discouraging left-handedness in their children. Luckily, this practice is rarely encountered today. It is the left side of the brain which is, however, still dominant. This is the side which deals with language; reading and writing, analysis and linear thinking. Logical thought is left-sided; as is numerical, digital and mathematical problem solving. The abstract and symbolic live in this side, as does our relationship to time (timekeeping and temporal awareness). Conversely, the right side of the brain (still referred to as the ‘minor’ side) is visual; spatial awareness is co-ordinated by this side of the brain. It is intuitive and subjective. ",

    title: 'Sailboat on the open' ,
    content: "None of them knew the colour of the sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colours of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.Many a man ought to have a bath-tub larger than the boat which here rode upon the sea. These waves were most wrongfully and barbarously abrupt and tall, and each froth-top was a problem in small boat navigation.The cook squatted in the bottom and looked with both eyes at the six inches of gunwale which separated him from the ocean. His sleeves were rolled over his fat forearms, and the two flaps of his unbuttoned vest dangled as he bent to bail out the boat. Often he said: “Gawd! That was a narrow clip.” As he remarked it he invariably gazed eastward over the broken sea. The oiler, steering with one of the two oars in the boat, sometimes raised himself suddenly to keep clear of water that swirled in over the stern. It was a thin little oar and it seemed often ready to snap. The correspondent, pulling at the other oar, watched the waves and wondered why he was there.",

    title: 'Shopping cart sign on cube shape dice' ,
    content: "Shopping Cart Sign: The inclusion of the shopping cart symbol may indicate a connection to online shopping or commerce. The shopping cart is commonly associated with e-commerce websites, representing a place where users can collect items for purchase. Cube Shape Dice: The use of a cube-shaped dice adds an interesting twist. A cube is a geometric shape with six faces, and a traditional six-sided die is cube-shaped. Each face of the die typically has a different number of dots, indicating a random outcome when rolled.Putting it together, the title might symbolize a random or unexpected aspect related to online shopping. It could suggest that, in the world of e-commerce, there are elements of chance, surprise, or unpredictability. The shopping cart sign on the dice may represent the randomness or variety of experiences one can encounter while engaging in online shopping.",
